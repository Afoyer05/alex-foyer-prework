Hi! My name is Alex Foyer, and I'm a recent graduate of Marquette University with a degree in Computer Engineering. More importantly, I don't have any idea what to write to fill up this space.
 This wouldn't normally be an issue, but unfortunately the assessment details specifically say that this text should be unique to me and not just lorem ipsum. With that in mind, I'm going to talk a
 litlle bit about one of the college classes i took that had a large impact on me and my education as a whole.

One of the major endeavors I undertook as an undergrad was my Senior Design Project. My team and I were tasked with developing a device to help people with hearing problems
(particularly those living in nursing homes/assisted living facilities) better respond to fire alarms. To that end, we designed a wifi-enabled bracelet equipped with a pager motor
that the staff could use to notify residents of a potential threat. My main responsibility in this project was to develop both the Android app that the staff could use to interface with the
 bracelet and the python server that all the communications went through. Getting a chance to work on a project for the entire year and bring it from a concept all the way to a completed device was an experience 
 unlike anything I'd had at college. It is, of all the programs I wrote in college, the one I'm most proud of (and also spent the most time on).
